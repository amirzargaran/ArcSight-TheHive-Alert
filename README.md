# ArcSight-TheHive-Alert
And now, for the first time, you can send alerts via action from ArcSight ESM Console to the TheHive when Correlation Rules are triggered.


All actions taken on a SIEM to enhance its functionalities are in line with the goal of being able to send the alerts and results of all detected incidents centrally to an Incident Response platform.
