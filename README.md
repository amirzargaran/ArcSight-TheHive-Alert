# ArcSight-TheHive-Alert
And now, for the first time, you can send alerts via action from ArcSight ESM Console to the TheHive when Correlation Rules are triggered.


All actions taken on a SIEM to enhance its functionalities are in line with the goal of being able to send the alerts and results of all detected incidents centrally to an Incident Response platform. One of the best Incident Response platforms is the TheHive. As you know, Some Add-ons have already been developed to integrate TheHive with Splunk Enterprise, but there was no way to integrate TheHive with ArcSight ESM.
Here you can find a general and extensible script that can be used as an execution command in ArcSight ESM, you can send the results of the triggered correlation rules  to the TheHive platform in the form of an Alert.
